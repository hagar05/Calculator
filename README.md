# Calculator
This code is written in MARIE assembly language. It is a calculator that does the basic mathematical operations(addition, subtraction, multiplication and division). It, also, does some pretty advanced operations as calculating Sin, Cos, Tan, Minimum, Maximum, Average, Power, Factorial, Prime Number Detection and Triangle Detection

To run the code, the user needs to use a MARIE simulator; either an online or an offline one, copy and paste the code in the simultor to run it.
To choose a specific operations, first, the user needs to access the code of each operation and type it( make sure the input is set to ASCII).
The code are listed bellow:
Addition: 002B
Subtraction: 002D
Multiplication: 002A
Division: 002F
Power: 005E
Sin: 0053
Cos: 0043
Tan: 0054
Factorial: 0021
Average & Maximum & Minimum: 004D
Prime Number Detection: 0050
Triangle Detection: 0044
